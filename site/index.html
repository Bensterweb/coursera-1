            <p>This sounds pretty heavy. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? What's a rerun? Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Just finishing up the second coat now. Jennifer.</p>

            <p>Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Save the clock tower. McFly. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.</p>

            <p>Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. </p>
